# **Ecom Express: Delivery Performance Analytics Dashboard**

## **Executive Summary**  
The Ecom Express project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze delivery performance metrics for the logistics company. The dashboard tracks delivery times, customer satisfaction, route efficiency, and operational bottlenecks. By consolidating data from various sources, it provides actionable insights to improve delivery performance, optimize routes, and enhance customer experience.

## **Business Problem**  
Ecom Express faced challenges in optimizing their delivery operations, including managing delivery times, improving route efficiency, and tracking performance across different regions. There was a lack of centralized visibility into key performance indicators (KPIs), leading to delayed responses to operational inefficiencies and missed opportunities for cost reduction.

## **Objective**  
The objective of this project was to create an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes delivery data, identifies bottlenecks, and offers actionable insights for improving operational efficiency, reducing delivery times, and enhancing customer satisfaction across different service regions.

## **Tools I Use**  
- **Power BI**: For creating the interactive dashboard and visualizing data.  
- **DAX**: For calculating key performance metrics and creating dynamic reports.  
- **SQL Server**: For querying and managing delivery performance data.  
- **Power Query**: For cleaning and transforming raw delivery data.

## **Suggestions**  
- Delivery times were observed to be longer in specific regions due to inefficient routes and local traffic patterns.  
- Implementing AI-powered route optimization could significantly reduce delivery time by 15-20%.  
- Identified a peak in delivery delays during the holiday season; additional resources should be allocated during this period to manage increased demand.  
- Customer satisfaction correlates closely with on-time deliveries, suggesting the need for a stronger focus on punctuality across the entire delivery network.

## **Challenges**  
A key challenge in the Ecom Express project was dealing with inconsistent data sources, where delivery logs contained missing or incorrect entries. Ensuring data quality required substantial effort in data cleansing using SQL and Power Query. Additionally, optimizing the Power BI dashboard to handle large volumes of real-time data while maintaining performance was complex, requiring careful structuring of the data model and careful selection of measures.

## **Learnings**  
- Gained expertise in DAX for calculating complex delivery metrics and KPIs.  
- Developed skills in data transformation using Power Query to handle inconsistent and incomplete data.  
- Learned how to design interactive Power BI dashboards focused on operational efficiency.  
- Improved understanding of logistics metrics and how to derive actionable insights to optimize business operations.  
- Enhanced skills in optimizing Power BI performance, ensuring fast data refresh rates and smooth user interaction.
