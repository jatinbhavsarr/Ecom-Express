# **Ecom Express: Ecommerce Platform Sales and Products Analytics**

## **Executive Summary**  
The Ecom Express project involves creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze the performance of an ecommerce platform selling clothes. The dashboard integrates data from customers, sellers, products, and deliveries to provide actionable insights on sales trends, customer behavior, inventory management, and delivery efficiency, helping improve decision-making and operational processes.

## **Business Problem**  
Ecom Express struggled to gain clear insights into its customer behavior, product sales trends, and delivery performance. The lack of a unified, real-time dashboard made it difficult for the business to optimize inventory, streamline operations, and enhance customer satisfaction, leading to missed opportunities for improving sales and operational efficiency.

## **Objective**  
The main goal of this project was to build a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that consolidates data from customers, sellers, products, and delivery operations to:
- Identify high-performing products and customer segments.
- Optimize inventory management based on sales trends.
- Improve delivery efficiency and reduce delays.
- Provide actionable insights to enhance decision-making in sales and operations.

## **Tools I Use**  
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.  
- **Power Query**: For data transformation, cleaning, and integration from multiple sources.

## **Suggestions**  
- Analyze customer behavior in high-spending regions to understand the drivers of high Average Order Value (AOV). Replicate successful strategies in other regions.  
- Design targeted promotions and special offers for customers in high AOV cities to maximize revenue potential.  
- Develop VIP programs and exclusive deals for high-spending customers to retain their loyalty and encourage more purchases.  
- Optimize inventory management to ensure sufficient stock during peak months.  
- Invest in localized marketing campaigns, partnerships, and events in key cities to further boost sales.

## **Challenges**  
A key challenge in this project was managing and integrating data from multiple sources, including customers, products, sellers, and delivery operations. Ensuring data accuracy and consistency across these various datasets required significant effort in cleaning and transforming the data using SQL and Power Query. Additionally, creating dynamic Power BI reports that provide real-time insights while maintaining dashboard performance was challenging, especially when dealing with large volumes of transactional data.

## **Learnings**  
- Gained hands-on experience with advanced DAX calculations to create meaningful business metrics and KPIs for sales and delivery performance.  
- Enhanced skills in Power Query for cleaning and transforming complex datasets from multiple sources.  
- Learned how to create actionable and user-friendly dashboards that present complex data in a simple and accessible format.  
- Improved understanding of customer behavior and sales trends in the ecommerce industry through data analysis.  
- Developed expertise in optimizing Power BI dashboards for performance, even with large datasets and multiple data sources.
